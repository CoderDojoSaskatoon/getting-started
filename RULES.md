# Twitch Stream Rules

1. We are here to have fun and learn something. There are lots of learners at different stages of their programming journey, be kind!
2. No spamming the Twitch chat, this includes posting the same question or request more than once a minute, posting links to unrelated things.
3. We vote on programming topics at the start of the stream. Sometimes yours isn't picked or you show up too late. It sucks when that happens, but please be respectful of the topic choice and the other watchers.
4. We usually have a help session after the stream. Sometimes I can't disrupt the stream for too long to give help. If you are stuck, hang in there and I should be able to help out after.
