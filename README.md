A guide to help you download and install programming applications

## Using a Terminal Program

### For Mac Computers
All Mac computer come with a terminal program installed on them. To find it go to Applications -> Utilities and select the "Terminal" application. This application is very basic but don't be fooled, you can do so much with it! Let's become more familiar with some terminal commands.

## Terminal Commands
To use a ccommand in the terminal, just type it in and hit "enter". Some commands will need arguments which you put in after your command with a space. Some will use special flags to change the command a little bit, you put those in after your command with a space and "-".

### For Mac Computers
`pwd` (print working directory) - this command will show where you are in your file structure. When you first start your terminal program you start in a special place called "root".

`cd` (change directory) - this command will let you change where you are in your file structure. To move into a folder try a command like `cd folder-name` where "folder-name" is the name of a folder. If you ever want to go back to a parent folder, you can use `cd ..` and if you ever want to go all the way back to your root directory, use `cd ~`

`ls` (list) - this command will list everything (folders and filers) in your current directory.

## Using `git`
Git is a special program that helps you save changes you make to your code and share them easily with others.

### `git` commands
#### `clone`
This will copy a repository from github.com to your computer. If you want to copy this repository, use your terminal and navigate to your project folder. Then use the command `git clone https://github.com/CoderDojoSaskatoon/getting-started`.

Be careful, if you already have a folder named "getting-started" in your project folder you will get an error.
