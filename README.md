## Using a Terminal Program

### For Mac Computers
All Mac computer come with a terminal program installed on them. To find it go to Applications -> Utilities and select the "Terminal" application. This application is very basic but don't be fooled, you can do so much with it! Let's become more familiar with some terminal commands.

## Terminal Commands
To use a ccommand in the terminal, just type it in and hit "enter". Some commands will need arguments which you put in after your command with a space. Some will use special flags to change the command a little bit, you put those in after your command with a space and "-".

### For Mac Computers
`pwd` (print working directory) - 

## Using `git`
Git is a special program that helps you save changes you make to your code and share them easily with others.

### `git` commands
#### `clone`
This will copy a repository from github.com to your computer. If you want to copy this repository, use your terminal and navigate to your project folder. Then use the command `git clone https://github.com/CoderDojoSaskatoon/getting-started`.

Be careful, if you already have a folder named "getting-started" in your project folder you will get an error.
